//  Please note the following:

//     * At 1 two data members are defined: they were defined as protected data members so that derived classes (e.g., see section 19.1.2.3) can access them.
//     * At 2 the buffer is set up. In the private section a small array of one character is defined, and setg() will set gptr() equal to egptr(). Since this implies that the buffer is empty, underflow() will be called to refill the buffer.
//     * At 3 and 4 underflow() will first see whether the buffer is really empty. If not, then the character to be retrieved next is returned.
//     * At line 5 the buffer is refilled. If this fails (for whatever reason), EOF is returned. More sophisticated implementations could react more intelligently here, of course.
// * At line 6 the buffer has been refilled, so setg() is called once again to set up streambuf's buffer pointers correctly.
